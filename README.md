# OverlayScrollbars
A minimalistic extension that transforms Firefox's scrollbars into semi-transparent overlay ones, saving window space and looking good.

Notes:
• If add-on page looks weird after installation just reload page [F5].
• If awesomebar gets broken after installation just restart Firefox.
